    Lester Serdenia, a software developer who loves turning ideas into digital realities.</p> <p>My journey began with a simple fascination for how things work -
    and evolved into a lifelong pursuit of crafting systems, apps, and games that make technology feel human.</p> <h1>My Story</h1> <p>I didn't just fall into
    coding - I grew into it.</p> <p><Over the years, I've written thousands of lines of code across .NET, Java, Salesforce customizations,Javascript, and Python,
    each project teaching me something new about problem solving and creativity.</p> <p>What started as tinkering with small scripts turned into building
    enterprise solutions, automating business processes, and even designing interactive games that tell stories through logic and play.</p> <p>Every piece of code
    I write is a reflection of curiosity - that spark that keeps me learning, experimenting, and improving.</p><br> <h1>What I Love Working On</h1> <p>.NET & Java
    - Crafting stable back-end systems that power meaningful applications.</p> <p>Salesforce - Automating workflows and building solutions that mae businesses run
    smoother.</p> <p>Javascript & Python - Bringing ideas to life through dynamic, data-driven applications.</p> <p>Game Development - Merging logic and creativity
    to create interactive experiences that inspire joy.</p>
    <h1>My Philosophy</h1>
    <p>Greate software isn't just about clean code - it's about connection.</p>
    <p>Between developer and user. Between logic and imagination. Between challenge and creativity.</p>
    <p>I believe every project is a story - and I love being the one who writes it in code.</p>
    <h1>Recent Highlights</p>
